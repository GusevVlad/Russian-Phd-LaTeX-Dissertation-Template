The possibility of the recovered uranium enrichment in a cascade of gas centrifuges with three feed flows (depleted uranium, low-enriched uranium, recovered uranium) with simultaneous dilution of U-232,234,236 isotopes was shown. A series of numerical experiments were performed for different content of U-235 in low-enriched uranium. It has been demonstrated that the selected combination of diluents can simultaneously reduce the cost of separative work and the consumption of natural uranium, not only with respect to the previously used multi-flow cascade schemes, but also in comparison to the standard cascade for uranium enrichment.},

abstract = {Among the several options to solve PWR spent fuel accumulation problem in Korea, the dry storage method could be the most realistic and applicable solution in the near future. As the basic objectives of dry storage are to prevent a gross rupture of spent fuel during operation and to keep its retrievability until transportation, at the same time the importance of a spent fuel integrity evaluation that can estimate its condition at the final stage of dry storage is very high. According to the national need and technology progress, two representative nations of spent fuel dry storage, the USA and Japan, have established different system temperature criteria, which is the only controllable factor in a dry storage system. However, there are no technical criteria for this evaluation in Korea yet, it is necessary to review the previously well-organized methodologies of advanced countries and to set up our own domestic evaluation direction due to the nation's need for dry storage. To satisfy this necessity, building a domestic spent fuel test database should be the first step. Based on those data, it is highly recommended to compare domestic data range with foreign results, to build our own criteria, and to expand on evaluation work into recently issued integrity problems by using a comprehensive integrity evaluation code.},

To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

abstract = {Future energy demand scenarios elaborated by international organisations tend to be ambitious in terms of the installed nuclear power capacity, particularly when trying to absorb the effects of a growing world population, to account for GDPs and to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Current light water reactors use thermal neutrons and burn uranium (a natural, finite resource), whereas some future Generation IV reactors using fast neutrons (starting with an initial fissile load) will be capable of recycling their own plutonium and already-extracted depleted uranium (self-sufficient or breeder fast reactors). The availability of uranium therefore has a direct impact on the capacity of the reactors that we can build. It is therefore important to have an accurate estimate of the available uranium resources in order to plan for the world's future nuclear reactor fleet. This paper discusses the correspondence between the resources (uranium and plutonium) and the nuclear power demand as estimated by various international organisations. Furthermore, the estimate of how much uranium can be recovered from phosphate rocks is questioned and the impact of our downscaled estimate on the deployment of a nuclear fleet is assessed accordingly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{IAEA2006,
abstract = {A. Introduction 1. Although different types of reactors have different types of fuel, the descriptions in this summary are, for simplicity, based primarily on the fuel used in light water reactors (LWRs). Most of the procedures and conclusions also apply to other types of reactor fuel. 2. Nuclear fuel consists of fuel pins that are stacks of uranium oxide or mixed uranium plutonium oxide (MOX) cylindrical ceramic pellets, with diameters of 8–15 mm, that are encapsulated in metallic tubes. The fuel pins are grouped together in fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly can be handled as a single entity, thus simplifying the fuelling and defuelling of reactors and the subsequent handling of spent nuclear fuel. 3. The useful life of a fuel element in the core of an operating reactor is usually 3–7 years. By the time it is removed from the core it is highly radioactive and generates both heat and radiation, primarily gamma radiation and neutrons. The fuel elements are therefore handled and stored under water, which provides both the necessary cooling and necessary radiation shielding. Over time both the radioactivity and the cooling requirements decrease. The minimum period for storing spent fuel under water is 9–12 months, after which cooling requirements have usually dropped enough that dry storage can be considered. Shielding requirements, however, remain for thousands of years. 4. The spent fuel is 95–96{\%} uranium with an enrichment level at or slightly above that of natural uranium, 1{\%} plutonium, 0.1{\%} other actinides and 3–4{\%} fission products. The uranium and plutonium can potentially be reused for new nuclear fuel.},

abstract = {This paper examines the difference in the value of the nuclear fuel cycle cost calculated by the deterministic and probabilistic methods on the basis of an equilibrium model. Calculating using the deterministic method, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR (sodiumcooled fast reactor) nuclear fuel cycle cost, including the reactor cost, were found to be 66.41 mills/kWh and 77.82 mills/kWh, respectively (1 mill = one thousand of a dollar, i.e., 10-3{\$}). This is because the cost of SFR is considerably expensive. Calculating again using the probabilistic method, however, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle cost, excluding the reactor cost, were found be 7.47 mills/kWh and 6.40 mills/kWh, respectively, on the basis of the most likely value. This is because the nuclear fuel cycle cost is significantly affected by the standard deviation and the mean of the unit cost that includes uncertainty. Thus, it is judged that not only the deterministic method, but also the probabilistic method, would also be necessary to evaluate the nuclear fuel cycle cost. By analyzing the sensitivity of the unit cost in each phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it was found that the uranium unit price is the most influential factor in determining nuclear fuel cycle costs.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss spent fuel management options in the Republic of Korea (ROK) from two interrelated perspectives: Centralized dry cask storage and spent fuel pyroprocessing and burning in sodium fast reactors (SFRs). We argue that the ROK will run out of space for at-reactors spent fuel storage by about the year 2030 and will thus need to transition centralized dry cask storage. Pyroprocessing plant capacity, even if approved and successfully licensed and constructed by that time, will not suffice to handle all the spent fuel discharged annually. Hence centralized dry cask storage will be required even if the pyroprocessing option is successfully developed by 2030. Pyroprocessing is but an enabling technology on the path leading to fissile material recycling and burning in future SFRs. In this regard we discuss two SFR options under development in the U.S.: the Super Prism and the Travelling Wave Reactor (TWR). We note that the U.S. is further along in reactor development than the ROK. The ROK though has acquired more experience, recently in investigating fuel recycling options for SFRs. We thus call for two complementary joint R{\&}D project to be conducted by U.S. and ROK scientists. One leading to the development of a demonstration centralized away-from-reactors spent fuel storage facility. The other involve further R{\&}D on a combined SFR-fuel cycle complex based on the reactor and fuel cycle options discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {As the options for spent fuel management may in the long term diversify due to evolving requirements and new priorities in strategic criteria, it is worthwhile identifying viable technical options for spent fuel treatment and their applicability to spent fuel management. The objective of this publication is to provide an update on the latest developments in nuclear reprocessing technologies in the light of new developments on the global nuclear scene. The background information on spent fuel reprocessing is provided in Section One. Substantial global growth of nuclear electricity generation is expected to occur during this century, in response to environmental issues and to assure the sustainability of the electrical energy supply in both industrial and less-developed countries. This growth carries with it an increasing responsibility to ensure that nuclear fuel cycle technologies are used only for peaceful purposes. In Section Two, an overview of the options for spent fuel reprocessing and their level of development are provided. A number of options exist for the treatment of spent fuel. Some, including those that avoid separation of a pure plutonium stream, are at an advanced level of technological maturity. These could be deployed in the next generation of industrial-scale reprocessing plants, while others (such as dry me thods) are at a pilot scal e, laboratory scale or conceptual stage of development. In Section Three, research and development in support of advanced reprocessing options is described. Next-generation spent fuel reprocessi ng plants are likely to be based on aqueous extraction processes that can be designed to a country specific set of spent fuel partitioning criteria for recycling of fissile materials to advanced light water reactors or fast spectrum reactors. The physical design of these plants must incorporate effective means for materials accountancy, safeguards and physical protection. Section four deals with issues and challenges related to spent fuel reprocessing. The spent fuel reprocessing options assessment of economics, proliferation resistan ce, and environmental impact are discussed. The importance of public acceptance for a reprocessing strategy is discussed. A review of modelling tools to support the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles is also given. As a conclusion, spent fuel reprocessing options have evolved significantly since the start of nuclear energy application. There is a large body of industrial experience in fuel cycle technologies complemented by research and development programs in several countries.},

abstract = {The economic goals of Generation IV nuclear energy systems, as adopted by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), are:  to have a life cycle cost advantage over other energy sources (i.e., to have a lower levelized unit cost of energy on average over their lifetime)  to have a level of financial risk comparable to other energy projects (i.e., to involve similar total capital investment and capital at risk). The Economics Crosscut Group of the Generation IV Roadmap Project recommended that a standardized cost estimating protocol be developed to provide decision makers with a credible basis to assess, compare, and eventually select future nuclear energy systems, taking into account a robust evaluation of their economic viability. The GIF accepted this recommendation and established the Economic Modeling Working Group (EMWG) to develop this protocol. This document provides a uniform set of assumptions, a uniform Code of Accounts (COA) and cost-estimating guidelines to be used in developing cost estimates for advanced nuclear energy systems. It discusses the development of all relevant life cycle costs for Generation IV systems, including the planning, research, development, demonstration (including prototype), deployment, and commercial stages. Software models, G4-ECONS, accompany this document. The combination of the software and guidelines facilitate the development of consistent, comprehensible cost estimates to be performed by the system development teams as requested by the GIF Policy and Experts Groups. The levelized unit of energy cost (LUEC) that is evaluated includes design, construction, commissioning, operations and maintenance, fuel cycle, and decommissioning costs for the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) through Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) commercial nuclear units. System development teams (System Steering Committees) are expected to provide feedback to the EMWG on these cost estimating guidelines and consult as needed with the EMWG when preparing cost and schedule estimates.},

abstract = {Historic data from many countries demonstrate that on average no more than 50-70{\%} of the uranium in a deposit could be mined. An analysis of more recent data from Canada and Australia leads to a mining model with an average deposit extraction lifetime of 10. ±. 2. years. This simple model provides an accurate description of the extractable amount of uranium for the recent mining operations.Using this model for all larger existing and planned uranium mines up to 2030, a global uranium mining peak of at most 58. ±. 4. ktons around the year 2015 is obtained. Thereafter we predict that uranium mine production will decline to at most 54. ±. 5. ktons by 2025 and, with the decline steepening, to at most 41. ±. 5. ktons around 2030. This amount will not be sufficient to fuel the existing and planned nuclear power plants during the next 10-20. years. In fact, we find that it will be difficult to avoid supply shortages even under a slow 1{\%}/year worldwide nuclear energy phase-out scenario up to 2025. We thus suggest that a worldwide nuclear energy phase-out is in order.If such a slow global phase-out is not voluntarily effected, the end of the present cheap uranium supply situation will be unavoidable. The result will be that some countries will simply be unable to afford sufficient uranium fuel at that point, which implies involuntary and perhaps chaotic nuclear phase-outs in those countries involving brownouts, blackouts, and worse. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical study of multicomponent isotope separation cascades. A theory is developed which leads to the multicomponent analogue of the two component "ideal cascade." The multicomponent analogue is a "matched abundance ratio cascade." Multicomponent analogues are derived for "value functions," "separative work," and various relationships of importance in two-component isotope separation cascade theory. The theory is applied specifically to the derivation of a multicomponent cost formula which could be used to price uranium containing U-236. (This cost formula is derived merely as an illustration of the theory and no recognition or commitment on the part of the U.S.A.E.C. is implied). The multicomponent matched abundance ratio cascade does not minimize total cascade flow as does the two-component ideal cascade. It is found, however, that for uranium isotope separation the total flow in the matched U-235/U-238 abundance ratio cascade exceeds the minimum by an insignificant fraction for a wide range of U-236 concentrations. {\textcopyright} 1961.},

abstract = {The CYCLE code is intended to simulate mathematically the operation of a nuclear power system (NPS) with thermal and fast reactors in an open or closed nuclear fuel cycle, to develop scenarios of efficient nuclear power evolution in Russia and to analyze trends in global nuclear power. The code is based on a well-known software program, WIMSD-5B, broadly used for the design of thermal reactor cells, and on a 2D multi-group software system, RZA, for the fast neutron reactor simulation. The CYCLE code was developed at IPPE in Obninsk. This paper presents a brief review of the capabilities and information on the current status of the CYCLE code. The code allows simulation of key facilities of the external fuel cycle (fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities, SNF storage, uranium, plutonium, neptunium, americium and curium stores, RW long-term storage sites), nuclear reactors, including RBMK-1000 reactors, existing and advanced VVER reactors (using different fuel types), and fast reactors (both existing and innovative). As an important feature, the CYCLE code allows the evolution of the fuel's nuclide composition both in reactors and at the external fuel cycle phase to be considered in details. Offered as an extra option is the capability to calculate a variety of the nuclear fuel cycle cost parameters for nuclear power plants with thermal and fast reactors. For years, the code has been successfully used as part of INPRO, an international innovative nuclear reactor and fuel cycle project. The results of studies into the Russian NPS evolution scenarios were presented at Global 2011. Some other of the CYCLE-based simulation results were presented at Global 2015.},

abstract = {The multiple recycling of uranium in light-water reactors is evaluated to understand its sustainability in multiple recycling scenarios and to evaluate its impact on fuel design and the fuel cycle. Two recycling scenarios were evaluated. One involves the mixing of repU with natU prior to reenrichment. A second involves the mixing of repU with 19.9{\%} EU to provide the new reactor fuel. The equilibrium concentrations of troublesome isotopes such as U-232 and U-236 are evaluated along with the required overenrichment of U-235. It was confirmed that a U-235 overenrichment factor of 0.28 applied to the U-236 concentration is sufficient to meet the cycle reactivity requirements and yields equilibrium enrichments of 5.06{\%} and 5.52{\%} for the two cycles, respectively. The impact on plutonium production and cycle reactivity is further evaluated to ensure the new fuel can meet the desired burnup requirements. Here, the plutonium production was found to be greater and the reactivity swing less in recycling scenarios with higher U-236 concentration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with investigation of the possibilities for reducing the risk of proliferation of fissionable materials by means of increasing the degree of protection of fresh fuel intended for light-water reactors against unsanctioned use in the case of withdrawal of a recipient country of deliveries from IAEA safeguards. It is shown that the use of recycled uranium for manufacturing export nuclear fuel makes transfer of nuclear material removed from the fuel assemblies for weapons purposes difficult because of the presence of isotope U, whose content increases when one attempts to enrich uranium extracted from fresh fuel. In combination with restricted access to technologies for isotope separation by means of establishing international centers for uranium enrichment, this technical measure can significantly reduce the risk of proliferation associated with export deliveries of fuel made of low-enriched uranium. The assessment of a maximum level of contamination of nuclear material being transferred by isotope U for the given isotope composition of the initial fuel is obtained. The concept of further investigations of the degree of security of export deliveries of fuel assemblies with recycled uranium intended for light-water reactors is suggested. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The use of fissionable materials accumulated during the open fuel cycle faces both challenges and opportunities for modern nuclear power engineering. A growing disproportion between the production and consumption of natural uranium draws attention to the problem of used nuclear fuel. The paper examines the current situation in the field of reuse (single or multiple) of reprocessed uranium (recovered from spent nuclear fuel), which is used for the production of low-enriched fuel (LEU) to fuel the fleet of light water reactors (LWR). The world experience in handling this material has been analysed. This study also gives an overview of the currently proposed methods for enriching the 235U content in reprocessed uranium to the required level by means of gas centrifugation process, while simultaneously meeting the limitations on the presence of 232,234,236U in commercial LEU. Savings of natural uranium was estimated for repeated recycling of VVER spent fuel. It was supposed that re-enrichment of reprocessed fuel would be done by arranging the most promising for such purposes cascade schemes. The obtained results can be used as a basis for further scientific, technical, and feasibility studies on the large-scale utilization of reusable materials in the different fuel cycles of LWR.},

abstract = {In the fasted state, induction of hepatic glucose output and fatty acid oxidation is essential to sustain energetic balance. Production and oxidation of glucose and fatty acids by the liver are controlled through a complex network of transcriptional regulators. Among them, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha plays an important role in hepatic and systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. We have previously demonstrated that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) regulates genes involved in gluconeogenesis through interaction and deacetylation of PGC-1alpha. Here, we show in vivo that hepatic SIRT1 is a factor in systemic and hepatic glucose, lipid, and cholesterol homeostasis. Knockdown of SIRT1 in liver caused mild hypoglycemia, increased systemic glucose and insulin sensitivity, and decreased glucose production. SIRT1 knockdown also decreased serum cholesterol and increased hepatic free fatty acid and cholesterol content. These metabolic phenotypes caused by SIRT1 knockdown tightly correlated with decreased expression of gluconeogenic, fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol degradation as well as efflux genes. Additionally, overexpression of SIRT1 reversed many of the changes caused by SIRT1 knockdown and depended on the presence of PGC-1alpha. Interestingly, most of the effects of SIRT1 were only apparent in the fasted state. Our results indicate that hepatic SIRT1 is an important factor in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in response to nutrient deprivation. As these pathways are dysregulated in metabolic diseases, SIRT1 may be a potential therapeutic target to control hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Obninsk Institute for Nuclear Power Engineering, National Research Nuclear University 'MEPhI'. All rights reserved. The paper is concerned with the commissioning of the new generation NPP-2006 power unit with the VVER-1200 reactor. A comparison is made between the characteristics of the new NvNPP II-1 and commercial VVER-1000 power units (B-320). Some design and circuit solutions used in the NPP-2006 project, which allowed increasing the installed capacity of the power unit, are described as well. The installed higher capacity of the power unit was achieved, in particular, due to increasing the primary circuit pressure by 0.5 MPa and the steam generator pressure by 0.6 MPa as well as improving the main circulation pump by 2000 m3/h. The main differences in the equipment and the composition of passive and active safety systems of the NPP-2006 power unit are considered. A brief description of the safety systems first applied at Russian power units is given, e.g., a two-channel structure of active safety systems with redundant emergency pumps in each channel, a double containment, a core melt localization device, a passive heat removal system, etc. Due to the increased number of BRU-Ks, it was possible to increase their performance from 15 to 3 seconds, which significantly improved the maneuverability of the power unit in abnormal conditions. The structure of the APCS is considered, which is applied in the NPP-2006 project, using programmable technology based on the TELEPERM XS platform. The peculiarities of commissioning of the power unit are analyzed, problematic issues that have arisen at various stages of the construction are revealed, some data on the tests carried out and the results of these tests are also given. Finally, an analysis is made of some design deficiencies revealed during the construction and commissioning of the power unit, an evaluation of the project was made, and proposals were formulated to finalize the VVER-1200 project for consideration in the subsequent NPP projects.},

abstract = {The multiple recycling of uranium in light-water reactors is evaluated to understand its sustainability in multiple recycling scenarios and to evaluate its impact on fuel design and the fuel cycle. Two recycling scenarios were evaluated. One involves the mixing of repU with natU prior to reenrichment. A second involves the mixing of repU with 19.9{\%} EU to provide the new reactor fuel. The equilibrium concentrations of troublesome isotopes such as U-232 and U-236 are evaluated along with the required overenrichment of U-235. It was confirmed that a U-235 overenrichment factor of 0.28 applied to the U-236 concentration is sufficient to meet the cycle reactivity requirements and yields equilibrium enrichments of 5.06{\%} and 5.52{\%} for the two cycles, respectively. The impact on plutonium production and cycle reactivity is further evaluated to ensure the new fuel can meet the desired burnup requirements. Here, the plutonium production was found to be greater and the reactivity swing less in recycling scenarios with higher U-236 concentration. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We articulate a need for new authoring tools to facilitate data sharing, and we discuss the tools we have been developing for this purpose. With these tools, data generation, analysis, and manuscript preparation can be deeply integrated, resulting in easier and better data sharing in scientific publications.},

abstract = {In natural uranium, there are trace amounts of the "minor isotope" 234U in addition to the more abundant 235U and 238U. Uranium irradiated in a reactor and separated from the spent reactor fuel by reprocessing will contain additional minor isotopes. In uranium enrichment, cascades of separating units are tuned to produce the desired level of the isotope 235U, but the levels of other isotopes will also change. Measurement of the assays of the 235U in the feed, product and withdrawal streams of each stage allow the calculation of the stage separation factor for the 235U. The separation factors for the other isotopes may be calculated. In this aritcle, two methods of modeling the separation factors in a way that represents the physics of two enrichment processes, gas centrifuge and gaseous diffusion, are explored. This technique could be a valuable tool in nuclear forensics. For example, it could be important to know the origin of a sample of highly enriched uranium, found either in intercepted material or in explosive debris. Analysis that could point to the enrichment plant where the uranium was produced could immediately identify weaknesses in safeguards and physical security systems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 AIP Publishing LLC. Uranium ore can be easily detected due to various gamma-ray energies emitted from uranium daughters particularly from238U daughters such as214Bi,214Pb and226Ra. After uranium is extracted from uranium ore, only low energy gamma-rays emitted from235U may be detected if the detector is placed in close contact to the specimen. In this research, identification and characterization of uranium bearing materials is experimentally investigated using direct measurement of gamma-rays from235U in combination with the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique. Measurement of gamma-rays can be conducted by using high purity germanium (HPGe) detector or cadmium telluride (CdTe) detector while a57Coradioisotope-excited XRF spectrometer using CdTe detector is used for elemental analysis. The proposed technique was tested with various uranium bearing specimens containing natural, depleted and enriched uranium in both metallic and powder forms.},

abstract = {When using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modelling system it is necessary to choose between many parametrisations for each physics option. This study examines the performance of various physics scheme combinations on the simulation of a series of rainfall events near the south-east coast of Australia known as East Coast Lows. A thirty-six member multi-physics ensemble was created such that each member had a unique set of physics parametrisations. No single ensemble member was found to perform best for all events, variables and metrics. This is reflected in the fact that different climate variables are found to be sensitive to different physical parametrisations. While a standardised super-metric can be used to identify best performers, a step-wise decision approach described here, allows explicit recognition of the “robustness” of choosing one parameterisation over another, allowing the identification of a group of “equally robustly” performing physics combinations. These results suggest that the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic planetary boundary layer scheme and the Betts-Miller-Janjic cumulus scheme can be chosen with some robustness. Possibly with greater confidence, the results also suggest that the Yonsei University planetary boundary layer scheme, Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme and RRTMG radiation scheme should not be used in combination in this region. Results further indicate that the selection of physics scheme options has larger impact on model performance during the more intensive rainfall events.},
